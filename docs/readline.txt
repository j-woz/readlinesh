== READLINESH

readlinesh - shell interface for readline editing and history

== SYNOPSIS

readline -h
readline [-d destination] [-p prompt] [-H history]

== DESCRIPTION

The readline command reads one line from the user, then writes that
line to the given _destination_.  The user is prompted with _prompt_
and has access to the history in _history_.

-h:: Print help message.
-d:: Write output to this file.  The default is stdout, which is
     useless (except for debugging).
-p:: Use this prompt.  Remember to escape characters special to the
     shell and spaces.  The default is "> ".
-H:: Use this history file.  The default is ~/.readlinesh-history .

== OPERATION

readline simply prompts the user for a single line of input, writes it
to the readline history file _history_, and writes it to the
_destination_ in plain text.

On SIGINT (Ctrl-C), readline handles the signal and writes the current
readline buffer to history.  This is intended for cases in which the
user cancels the shell script calling readline, but desires to quickly
restart.

To prevent writing to history, clear the line and provide the EOF
character (Ctrl-D).  The keystroke shortcut for this is: Ctrl-A Ctrl-K
Ctrl-D, that is, move to home column, clear the line, and provide
EOF.

== EXAMPLE

Consider a fast revision control commit shell function that accepts
the commit message in an interactive (readline) prompt instead of
launching the editor.  The benefits of this are:
 1) not clearing the screen
 2) speed if the editor startup is slow
 3) history!

Such a function would look like:

c() {
    MESSAGE_FILE=$( mktemp )
    readline -d $MESSAGE_FILE -p "Enter message: " -H ~/.commit-msgs
    svn commit -F $MESSAGE_FILE $*
    rm $MESSAGE_FILE
}

If the user cancels the function with Ctrl-C, the message is still
accessible in history.  So if you realize that you do not want to
commit, you can cancel, make a fix, and commit again, retrieving your
partially completed commit message from history.
